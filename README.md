ELEC3300 project code and documentation

This is an interesting course about STM32 Embedded system. My team choose to build an autodrawing machine based on the STM32F103VET6 chipset. The detailed material list can be found at the project proposal. 

If you have any questions about this project or you want to build one by yourself, feel free to contact me at ydual@connect.ust.hk
